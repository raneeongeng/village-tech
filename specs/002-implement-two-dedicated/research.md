# Research Findings: Household Management Pages

**Date**: 2025-01-10
**Feature**: Household Management Pages - Active/Pending/Add Modal

## Technical Decisions

### Multi-Step Transaction Handling

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL functions with RPC calls for atomic household creation operations

**Rationale**:
- Current codebase shows application-level rollback patterns in `useCreateVillage.ts`
- Database functions provide true atomicity for complex multi-step operations (User → Household → Members)
- Supabase Auth user creation cannot be part of DB transactions, requiring hybrid approach
- Error handling becomes cleaner with automatic rollback on function exceptions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure application-level rollback (current pattern): Complex error handling, potential data inconsistency
- Optimistic UI updates: High risk due to authentication and validation complexity
- Separate service layer: Adds unnecessary complexity for this domain

### Form Validation Strategy

**Decision**: Implement React Hook Form with Zod schema validation for step-wise validation

**Rationale**:
- Current codebase uses basic React state for form handling
- Zod provides type-safe validation that can be shared between client and server
- React Hook Form offers better performance and built-in field array support for members
- Step-wise validation aligns with modal's three-section structure

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Continue with current useState pattern: Limited validation, no type safety
- Formik + Yup: Heavier bundle size, less TypeScript integration
- Custom validation: Reinventing the wheel, maintenance burden

### Table Pagination and Search

**Decision**: Implement server-side pagination with URL state management and debounced search

**Rationale**:
- Current `useVillages` fetches all data without pagination implementation
- Supporting 1000+ households requires server-side operations for performance
- URL state enables bookmarkable filtered views and browser back/forward navigation
- Debounced search (300ms) matches existing `useDebounce` pattern in codebase

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Client-side filtering: Won't scale with 1000+ records requirement
- Infinite scrolling: Less suitable for administrative data management
- Static pagination: Doesn't support deep-linking to filtered states

### Error Handling Pattern

**Decision**: Use Next.js 14 App Router error.tsx boundaries with pessimistic UI updates

**Rationale**:
- Household creation is high-stakes operation requiring confirmation
- App Router provides built-in error boundary support at route level
- Pessimistic approach provides better user confidence for complex operations
- Progress indicators maintain good UX during multi-step processes

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Optimistic updates: Too risky for user account creation and multi-tenant operations
- Global error handling: Less granular, harder to provide contextual recovery options
- Toast-only errors: Insufficient feedback for complex operation failures

### Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: Implement SWR for lookup data caching with server-side table operations

**Rationale**:
- Lookup values (statuses, relationships) are relatively static and shared across forms
- SWR provides automatic background revalidation and request deduplication
- Server-side filtering reduces client memory usage and improves search performance
- Matches existing patterns while adding modern caching layer

**Alternatives Considered**:
- React Query: Similar benefits but SWR is lighter and more focused
- Context-based caching: Custom implementation complexity without additional benefits
- No caching: Repeated API calls for static lookup data

### Security and Tenant Isolation

**Decision**: Enhance existing tenant isolation patterns with email uniqueness validation

**Rationale**:
- Current codebase demonstrates tenant isolation in `useCreateVillage` and RLS policies
- Email uniqueness must be checked across all tenants to prevent account conflicts
- Input sanitization follows existing patterns with TypeScript type safety
- Audit logging maintains consistency with established platform patterns

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Per-tenant email validation: Could allow duplicate emails across villages (problematic)
- No pre-validation: Would result in Supabase Auth errors during submission
- Complex email scoping: Overengineered for the authentication requirements

## Implementation Patterns

### Hook Architecture
- **useHouseholds**: Server-side pagination with filtering for active/inactive households
- **usePendingHouseholds**: Specialized version for pending approval status
- **useHouseholdActions**: Centralized approve/reject/toggle operations
- **useCreateHousehold**: Multi-step creation with transaction handling

### Component Structure
- **ResponsiveTable**: Generic reusable table component with mobile optimization
- **HouseholdTable**: Domain-specific implementation with status badges and actions
- **AddHouseholdModal**: Three-section modal with form validation and progress tracking
- **Modal components**: Approval/Rejection confirmation dialogs

### Database Optimization
- PostgreSQL functions for atomic operations
- Composite indexes for search performance
- Single queries with relationship joins to reduce round trips
- Row Level Security for automatic tenant isolation

### User Experience
- Skeleton loaders during data fetching
- Progress indicators for multi-step operations
- Mobile-responsive table with column hiding
- URL-based filter state for bookmarkable views

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript with Zod schema validation
2. **Performance**: Server-side operations, debounced search, lookup caching
3. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML
4. **Security**: Input sanitization, tenant isolation, audit logging
5. **Maintainability**: Modular hooks, reusable components, consistent patterns
6. **Testing**: Component isolation enables unit testing of business logic

These decisions align with the existing codebase patterns while incorporating modern best practices for scalability and user experience.
