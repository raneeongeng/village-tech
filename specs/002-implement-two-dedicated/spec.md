# Feature Specification: Household Management Pages

**Feature Branch**: `002-implement-two-dedicated`
**Created**: 2025-01-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement two dedicated pages for head administrators to manage households within their village: Active Households Page (view and manage all approved/active households) and Pending Households Page (review and approve/reject new household applications). Include Add New Household Modal for creating new household applications with comprehensive form sections for household information, head details, and optional family members."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View and Manage Active Households (Priority: P1)

A head administrator needs to view all approved households in their village, see key information at a glance, and perform basic management tasks like temporarily deactivating a household or viewing detailed information.

**Why this priority**: This is the core administrative function that enables day-to-day household management. Without this, administrators cannot effectively oversee their village community.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as a head admin, navigating to active households page, and verifying all household data displays correctly with functional search and status toggle capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a logged-in head administrator, **When** I navigate to the active households page, **Then** I see a table of all approved households with name, address, member count, and action buttons
2. **Given** I am viewing active households, **When** I search for a household by name or address, **Then** the table filters to show matching results only
3. **Given** I am viewing a specific household, **When** I click the toggle status button, **Then** I can change it from active to inactive (or vice versa) with confirmation
4. **Given** I have many households, **When** I view the households table, **Then** I see pagination controls and can navigate through pages of results

### User Story 2 - Review and Approve Pending Applications (Priority: P1)

A head administrator needs to review new household applications that are awaiting approval, see applicant details, and approve or reject applications to control village access.

**Why this priority**: This is equally critical as it controls access to the village. Without approval capabilities, no new households can join the community, blocking growth and new resident onboarding.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating test pending applications, then logging in as head admin to view, approve, and reject applications with appropriate status updates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** there are pending household applications, **When** I navigate to the pending approvals page, **Then** I see a table of applications with applicant name, application date, and action buttons
2. **Given** I am viewing a pending application, **When** I click approve, **Then** I see a confirmation dialog and can approve the household for village access
3. **Given** I am viewing a pending application, **When** I click reject, **Then** I see a confirmation dialog and can reject the application with optional reason
4. **Given** I approve/reject an application, **When** the action completes, **Then** the application is removed from pending list and appropriate notifications are triggered

### User Story 3 - Create New Household Applications (Priority: P2)

A head administrator can create new household applications on behalf of prospective residents, entering household head information, address details, and optional family member information to streamline the onboarding process.

**Why this priority**: While important for administrative efficiency, this is secondary to viewing and managing existing households. Admins can manually handle applications through other channels if this feature is delayed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the add household modal, completing the form with valid data, and verifying the household is created in pending status with correct information stored.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the active households page, **When** I click "Add Household", **Then** I see a modal form with sections for household information, head details, and optional members
2. **Given** I am filling the add household form, **When** I complete all required fields and submit, **Then** a new household is created in pending status with user account for the household head
3. **Given** I am adding household members, **When** I fill member details and click "Add Member", **Then** the member is added to a preview list with ability to remove before submission
4. **Given** form validation is active, **When** I enter invalid data (duplicate email, weak password, invalid phone), **Then** I see clear error messages and cannot submit until corrected

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a head admin tries to approve/reject households from a different village (should be prevented by tenant isolation)?
- How does the system handle duplicate email addresses when creating new household heads?
- What occurs when network connectivity is lost during household creation or approval processes?
- How does the system respond when search queries return no results or very large result sets?
- What happens when required lookup data (statuses, relationships) is missing from the system?
