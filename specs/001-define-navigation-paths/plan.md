# Implementation Plan: Role-Based Navigation Paths

**Branch**: `001-define-navigation-paths` | **Date**: 2025-01-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-define-navigation-paths/spec.md`

## Summary

Create a role-based navigation system that provides distinct navigation arrays for five user roles (superadmin, admin-head, admin-officer, household-head, security-officer) in the Village Management Platform. The system will enforce role-based access control at the navigation level while maintaining hierarchical organization of features by functional areas.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript with Next.js 14+ App Router
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18+, Next.js 14+, existing auth system, TailwindCSS
**Storage**: Configuration-based (navigation defined in TypeScript files, role data from Supabase)
**Testing**: Jest/Vitest for navigation logic and role validation
**Target Platform**: Web application (responsive design for desktop, tablet, mobile)
**Project Type**: Web application component within existing Next.js project
**Performance Goals**: Navigation renders within 100ms, role-based filtering completes instantly
**Constraints**: Must integrate with existing authentication system, maintain VMP design system compliance
**Scale/Scope**: 5 distinct user roles, approximately 15-20 navigation items per role maximum

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **Technology Stack Compliance**: Uses Next.js 14+ App Router with TypeScript - ✅ PASS
✅ **Design System Compliance**: Uses TailwindCSS with VMP color palette - ✅ PASS
✅ **Role-Based Access Control**: Implements comprehensive RBAC with five distinct roles and permission-based filtering - ✅ PASS
✅ **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Navigation respects tenant boundaries through role system and user context - ✅ PASS
✅ **Component Reusability**: Navigation uses atomic design with modular, composable components - ✅ PASS
✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with Zod validation and strict typing - ✅ PASS
✅ **Development Standards**: Uses React Hook Form patterns and Docker-compatible development - ✅ PASS
✅ **Testing Coverage**: Includes Jest/Vitest tests for business logic and integration testing - ✅ PASS

**Post-Design Re-evaluation**: ✅ ALL GATES STILL PASSED
- Design maintains constitutional compliance
- Implementation follows VMP architectural principles
- Security and performance requirements met

**Structure Decision**: Extends existing Next.js project structure with new navigation-specific modules. Integrates with existing `src/hooks/useNavigation.tsx` and `src/components/layout/` components while adding dedicated navigation configuration and utilities.
