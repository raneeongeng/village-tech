# Tasks: Role-Based Navigation Paths

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-define-navigation-paths/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ, quickstart.md ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in feature specification - focusing on implementation tasks

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Next.js project**: `src/` at repository root with App Router structure
- Paths based on plan.md structure: `src/components/navigation/`, `src/lib/navigation/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/types/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Navigation system initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 [P] Create navigation component directory structure in `src/components/navigation/`
- [x] T002 [P] Create navigation library directory structure in `src/lib/navigation/`
- [x] T003 [P] Create navigation types file in `src/types/navigation.ts`
- [x] T004 [P] Set up navigation test directory structure in `tests/components/navigation/`
- [x] T005 [P] Set up navigation library test structure in `tests/lib/navigation/`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core navigation infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T006 Create base navigation TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/navigation.ts`
- [ ] T007 [P] Create NavigationItem type definition with validation schema
- [ ] T008 [P] Create NavigationGroup type definition

- [ ] T012 [P] Create navigation utility functions framework in `src/lib/navigation/utils.ts`
- [ ] T013 [P] Create base navigation component structure in `src/components/navigation/index.ts`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Core Role Navigation Access (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to see only navigation links relevant to their role and permissions

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as any role and verifying that only appropriate navigation items are visible

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Define superadmin navigation configuration in `src/lib/navigation/config.ts`
- [ ] T015 [P] [US1] Define admin_head navigation configuration in `src/lib/navigation/config.ts`
- [ ] T016 [P] [US1] Define admin_officer navigation configuration in `src/lib/navigation/config.ts`

- [ ] T027 [P] [US1] Create navigation component tests in `tests/components/navigation/Navigation.test.tsx`

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently - users see role-appropriate navigation

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Navigation Hierarchy and Organization (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Present navigation items logically grouped and hierarchically organized according to role's functional areas

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by examining navigation structure for each role and verifying logical grouping of related features

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T028 [P] [US2] Define navigation groups for each role in `src/lib/navigation/config.ts`
- [ ] T029 [US2] Implement `groupNavigationItems()` function in `src/lib/navigation/utils.ts`

- [ ] T037 [P] [US2] Create NavigationGroup component tests in `tests/components/navigation/NavigationGroup.test.tsx`

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - navigation is filtered AND organized

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Navigation Permission Enforcement (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Ensure navigation paths are strictly enforced based on user roles with proper security validation

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to access restricted navigation paths for each role and verifying appropriate access controls

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T038 [P] [US3] Create navigation permission validation in `src/lib/navigation/permissions.ts`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 navigation structure but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Adds security to US1/US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Configuration before utilities
- Utilities before components
- Base components before enhanced components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Role configurations within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Component development marked [P] can run in parallel
- Test development marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all role configurations for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Define superadmin navigation configuration in src/lib/navigation/config.ts"
Task: "Define admin_head navigation configuration in src/lib/navigation/config.ts"
Task: "Define admin_officer navigation configuration in src/lib/navigation/config.ts"
Task: "Define household_head navigation configuration in src/lib/navigation/config.ts"
Task: "Define security_officer navigation configuration in src/lib/navigation/config.ts"

# Launch all component development for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create NavigationItem component in src/components/navigation/NavigationItem.tsx"
Task: "Create Navigation container component in src/components/navigation/Navigation.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo role-based navigation filtering

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!) - Basic role-based navigation
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo - Organized navigation groups
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo - Secure navigation enforcement
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Core role navigation)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Navigation organization)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Permission enforcement)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Navigation integrates with existing VMP authentication and layout systems
- Follows VMP constitution requirements for TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and RBAC
- Maintains performance goals (< 100ms navigation render time)
- Supports all 5 user roles: superadmin, admin_head, admin_officer, household_head, security_officer
