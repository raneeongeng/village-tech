# Feature Specification: Role-Based Navigation Paths

**Feature Branch**: `001-define-navigation-paths`
**Created**: 2025-01-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Define navigation paths for all user roles in the Village Management Platform. Each role should have an array of navigation links that they can access. Roles include: superadmin, admin-head, admin-officer, household-head, security-officer."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Core Role Navigation Access (Priority: P1)

As a user with a specific role in the Village Management Platform, I need to see only the navigation links that are relevant to my permissions and responsibilities, so that I can efficiently access the features I'm authorized to use without being overwhelmed by irrelevant options.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation that enables role-based access control and user experience. Without proper navigation paths, users cannot effectively use the system regardless of their role.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as any role and verifying that only appropriate navigation items are visible, delivering immediate value through organized interface access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a superadmin is logged in, **When** they view the navigation, **Then** they see all available navigation links including system-wide management options
2. **Given** an admin-head is logged in, **When** they view the navigation, **Then** they see village management, household management, and administrative links but not system-wide controls
3. **Given** a household-head is logged in, **When** they view the navigation, **Then** they see only household-specific and resident-facing options
4. **Given** a security-officer is logged in, **When** they view the navigation, **Then** they see security and access control related navigation items

### User Story 2 - Navigation Hierarchy and Organization (Priority: P2)

As a user of any role, I need navigation items to be logically grouped and hierarchically organized according to my role's functional areas, so that I can quickly find and access related features without confusion.

**Why this priority**: Enhances user efficiency and reduces training time by presenting navigation in a logical, role-appropriate structure.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by examining navigation structure for each role and verifying logical grouping of related features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin-officer is logged in, **When** they view navigation, **Then** navigation items are grouped by functional area (e.g., "Household Management", "Fee Management", "Delivery Management")
2. **Given** any user accesses navigation, **When** they look for related features, **Then** related navigation items appear together in logical groups

### User Story 3 - Navigation Permission Enforcement (Priority: P3)

As a system administrator, I need navigation paths to be strictly enforced based on user roles, so that users cannot access unauthorized features even if they attempt direct navigation.

**Why this priority**: Ensures security and data integrity by preventing unauthorized access attempts through navigation manipulation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to access restricted navigation paths for each role and verifying appropriate access controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a household-head user, **When** they attempt to access admin-only navigation paths, **Then** they are prevented from seeing or accessing those options
2. **Given** a security-officer user, **When** they try to access financial management navigation, **Then** those navigation items are not available to them

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's role changes while they're logged in?
- How does the system handle navigation for users with multiple roles or role inheritance?
- What navigation is shown to users with inactive or suspended accounts?
- How does navigation behave when certain features are temporarily disabled for maintenance?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST define distinct navigation arrays for each of the five user roles (superadmin, admin-head, admin-officer, household-head, security-officer)
- **FR-002**: System MUST organize navigation links hierarchically based on functional areas for each role
- **FR-003**: Navigation paths MUST be restricted so users can only see links appropriate to their assigned role
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a comprehensive navigation structure for superadmin that includes all platform features
- **FR-005**: Admin-head navigation MUST include village management, household oversight, fee management, and administrative functions
- **FR-006**: Admin-officer navigation MUST include household processing, fee collection, and delivery management functions
- **FR-007**: Household-head navigation MUST include household management, family member management, and resident services
- **FR-008**: Security-officer navigation MUST include access control, visitor management, and security monitoring functions
- **FR-009**: Navigation structure MUST support grouping of related features under logical categories
- **FR-010**: System MUST enforce navigation permissions at the route level to prevent unauthorized access

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Navigation Item**: Represents a single link with path, label, icon, and permission requirements
- **Role Navigation Map**: Associates each user role with their permitted navigation items
- **Navigation Group**: Logical grouping of related navigation items (e.g., "Management", "Reports", "Settings")
- **Permission Level**: Defines access level required for specific navigation paths

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Each of the 5 user roles has a defined set of navigation paths with no overlap of unauthorized features
- **SC-002**: Users can locate their primary functions within 2 clicks from the main navigation
- **SC-003**: 100% of navigation links are properly restricted based on user role permissions
- **SC-004**: Navigation structure reduces time to access core features by at least 30% compared to unorganized navigation
- **SC-005**: Zero unauthorized access attempts succeed through navigation path manipulation

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

- User roles are already defined in the system with clear permission boundaries
- The platform uses a role-based access control system that can be integrated with navigation
- Navigation will be implemented as a client-side component that respects server-side permission validation
- Each user is assigned exactly one primary role for navigation purposes
- Navigation structure will be consistent across different device types (desktop, tablet, mobile)

## Dependencies *(mandatory)*

- Existing user authentication and role management system
- Role-based permission system that can validate navigation access
- Frontend routing system that supports permission-based route protection
- User interface components for navigation display and interaction

## Out of Scope *(mandatory)*

- Implementation of the underlying permission system (assumed to exist)
- User role assignment or role management features
- Navigation styling or visual design specifications
- Multi-language navigation support
- Dynamic navigation based on user preferences
- Navigation analytics or usage tracking
