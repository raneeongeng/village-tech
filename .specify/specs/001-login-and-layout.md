# Feature Specification: Login Page and Post-Login Layout

**Feature Branch**: `001-login-and-layout`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create the Login Page and Post-Login Layout (sidebar + header) for the Village Management Platform (VMP)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Login Authentication (Priority: P1)

A user visits the login page, enters valid credentials, and successfully logs into their village's management system, being redirected to the dashboard.

**Why this priority**: Core authentication is the foundation requirement - without it, no other features can be accessed. This delivers immediate value by enabling user access to the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to login page, entering valid email/password, and verifying successful redirect to dashboard with "Coming Soon" message.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on login page, **When** user enters valid email and password, **Then** user is authenticated and redirected to `/dashboard`
2. **Given** user enters invalid credentials, **When** user submits form, **Then** appropriate error message is displayed without redirect
3. **Given** user is already authenticated, **When** user visits login page, **Then** user is automatically redirected to `/dashboard`

---

### User Story 2 - Multi-Tenant Context Detection (Priority: P2)

A user accesses the system via subdomain (e.g., `greenville.vmp.app`) and the system automatically detects their village context for authentication.

**Why this priority**: Multi-tenancy is core to the platform's business model, enabling multiple villages to use the same system while maintaining data isolation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing different subdomains and verifying that tenant context is properly detected and used for authentication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user accesses `greenville.vmp.app/login`, **When** user logs in, **Then** authentication occurs within Greenville tenant context
2. **Given** subdomain cannot be detected, **When** user visits login page, **Then** tenant selector dropdown is displayed
3. **Given** user selects tenant from dropdown, **When** user authenticates, **Then** login occurs within selected tenant context

---

### User Story 3 - Role-Based Layout Rendering (Priority: P3)

After login, users see a layout with sidebar navigation items that match their specific role permissions within their village.

**Why this priority**: Role-based navigation sets up the foundation for all future features and provides users with appropriate access based on their responsibilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in with different role accounts and verifying that sidebar shows correct menu items for each role.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Superadmin user logs in, **When** dashboard loads, **Then** sidebar shows all administrative menu items (Villages, Users, Payments, etc.)
2. **Given** Household-Head user logs in, **When** dashboard loads, **Then** sidebar shows limited menu items (My Household, Requests, Deliveries, Rules)
3. **Given** Security-Officer user logs in, **When** dashboard loads, **Then** sidebar shows security-specific items (Gate Logs, Visitors, Incidents)

---

### User Story 4 - Responsive Layout Experience (Priority: P4)

Users can access the system from mobile devices and experience a responsive layout that adapts the sidebar and header appropriately.

**Why this priority**: Mobile access is essential for security officers and field staff who need system access while on duty.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the system on mobile devices and verifying layout adapts properly with collapsible sidebar.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user accesses system on mobile, **When** layout renders, **Then** sidebar is collapsed by default with hamburger menu
2. **Given** user is on tablet, **When** screen orientation changes, **Then** layout adapts appropriately
3. **Given** user toggles sidebar on mobile, **When** sidebar opens/closes, **Then** main content area adjusts smoothly

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user's session expires while navigating the application?
- How does system handle authentication when Supabase is temporarily unavailable?
- What occurs when user's role is changed while they're logged in?
- How does system behave when subdomain doesn't match any existing tenant?
- What happens when user attempts to access routes they don't have permission for?
