# Tasks: Login Page and Post-Login Layout (with Design Reference)

**Input**: Design documents from `.specify/specs/001-login-and-layout/` with design reference integration
**Prerequisites**: plan-v2.md (required), spec-v2.md (required for user stories), design/login.html (design reference)

**Tests**: Tests are included for quality assurance and TDD approach. Visual regression testing added for design compliance.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story, with design reference integration throughout.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- **[DR]**: Design Reference specific tasks
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Next.js App Router**: `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/`, `src/hooks/`
- **Testing**: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`, `tests/visual/`
- **Design Reference**: `design/login.html` (source), `src/styles/design-reference.css`
- **Configuration**: Root-level config files

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Design Integration & Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 authentication but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1 authentication, independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Depends on US3 completion for layout components, can be developed in parallel with design reference integration

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD approach)
- Design Reference (DR) tasks can often run in parallel with functional implementation
- Visual tests should be written after basic implementation to validate design compliance
- UI components before integration
- Core functionality before styling enhancements
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1-3 can start in parallel
- User Story 4 can start once User Story 3 layout components are available
- Design Reference [DR] tasks can often run parallel to functional implementation
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- UI components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Visual regression tests can run in parallel across different stories

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Enhanced with Design Reference)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Visual regression test for login page layout in tests/visual/login-design.spec.ts"
Task: "Unit test for login form validation in tests/unit/components/auth/LoginForm.test.tsx"
Task: "Integration test for Supabase authentication flow in tests/integration/auth-flow.test.ts"
Task: "E2E test for complete login to dashboard journey in tests/e2e/login.spec.ts"

# Launch parallel UI components for User Story 1:
Task: "Create login page main container matching design structure in src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx"
Task: "Create BrandingArea component (right column) in src/app/(auth)/login/components/BrandingArea.tsx"
Task: "Create login page auth layout in src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx"
Task: "Create dashboard placeholder page in src/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx"

# Design Reference specific tasks can run parallel:
Task: "Apply VMP color palette to design reference structure"
Task: "Update branding from 'Tenant Management' to 'Village Manager'"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only with Design Compliance)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (including design reference analysis)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (with design reference integration)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently + verify design compliance
5. Deploy/demo basic authentication system with design-compliant UI

### Incremental Delivery (Design-Enhanced)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Validate design compliance ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Design-Compliant Login MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Multi-tenant system with design consistency)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Role-based navigation)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Mobile responsive with design consistency)
6. Design Integration & Polish ‚Üí Final production system with full design compliance

### Parallel Team Strategy (Design-Enhanced)

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T021)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 functional implementation (T026-T032)
   - Developer B: User Story 1 design integration (T033-T038)
   - Developer C: User Story 2 preparation (T043-T045)
3. Design specialist can work on visual tests and design compliance throughout
4. Stories integrate smoothly due to shared foundation and design system
