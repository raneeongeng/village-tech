# Tasks: Login Page and Post-Login Layout

**Input**: Design documents from `.specify/specs/001-login-and-layout/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), constitution.md

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL for this feature. Unit and E2E tests will be included for quality assurance.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Next.js App Router**: `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/`, `src/hooks/`
- **Testing**: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`
- **Configuration**: Root-level config files

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 authentication but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1 authentication, independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Depends on US3 completion for layout components, but can be developed in parallel

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- UI components before integration
- Core functionality before styling
- Individual features before cross-feature integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1-3 can start in parallel
- User Story 4 can start once User Story 3 layout components are available
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- UI components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for login form validation in tests/unit/components/auth/LoginForm.test.tsx"
Task: "Integration test for Supabase authentication flow in tests/integration/auth-flow.test.ts"
Task: "E2E test for complete login to dashboard journey in tests/e2e/login.spec.ts"

# Launch parallel UI components for User Story 1:
Task: "Create login page layout in src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx"
Task: "Create dashboard placeholder page in src/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx"
Task: "Create protected routes layout in src/app/(protected)/layout.tsx"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo basic authentication system

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Basic Login MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Multi-tenant system)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Role-based navigation)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Mobile responsive)
6. Polish ‚Üí Final production system

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T017)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T018-T030)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T031-T041)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T042-T055)
3. User Story 4 starts after User Story 3 layout components (T046-T048) complete
4. Stories integrate smoothly due to shared foundation

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All components follow VMP design system (constitution compliance)
- Multi-tenant data isolation enforced at all levels
- Role-based access control implemented throughout
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
